  work thanks to Rainer Weikusat!
* Removed all 'FindNewTable' calls in all tests. Just use 't1' for all tests to 
  simplify things. Plus, this is how MySQL internall tests.

    Converted Steve's dbi.pl script to expose this problem to 40bindparam2
    test.
  * Fix to mysql_st_internal_execute to keep from passing undefined dbh

    itself. Thanks to Jason Snell for giving me a good script to reproduce
    this!
  * Fix to parse_params, mysql.xs dbh->do, and bind_param to deal with

    column is defined as utf8 in mysql.

2005-09-26 Patrick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (3.0002_2)
  * Fixed bug in dbd_st_execute where imp_sth was being 
    imported unecessarily, when only imp_dbh is needed. This caused a 
    core dump in some cases. Thanks to Andy Maas at Proofpoint for his 
    execellent detective work!
  * Small changes to Makefile.PL to make sure --ps-protocol works as
    advertised.
  * Updated install.html with current info about prepared statements and FC
    RPM/YUM packages.

2005-08-04 Patrick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (3.0002_1)
  * Prepared statement support is default now. To turn it off
    a parameter 'mysql_emulated_prepare' must be turned ON
  * Better error handling in mysql_internal_execute_ps (renamed
    from mysql_internal_execute41). Also free the result if error -
    that could have been a memory bug
  * Added a simply 'do' to t/35prepare.test to see if you can turn
    off prepared statements in the 'do' call.
  * Cleaned up a LOT of cruft. Added more 'caveat' blurbage to old
    Mysql.pm lib, which will not work with prepared statements
  
2005-07-06 Parick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (3.0001_3)
  * Fix to ensure MYSQL_BIND is only defined when mysql
    client version is >= 4.1.3. Thanks to Tom Parkison

2005-07-06 Patrick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (3.0001_2)
  * Fixed runtime bug (when inserting or updating quotes or double quotes)
    (Thanks to Brad Choate, Six Apart Ltd.)

2005-07-04 Patrick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (3.0001_1)
  * Changed uint argument in safe_sv_fetch to int due to 
    uint not being available on windows unless you include
    my_globals.h in dbdimp.h, which also breaks on unixen!
  * Removed // comments from mysql.xs (thanks Bodo Bergman!)

2005-07-03 Patrick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (3.0000_0)
  * Special Thanks to Steve Hay for his patch to fix windows

    in dbdimp.c
  * Modified Makefile.PM to make prepared statements on by default

2005-04-26 Patrick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (2.9015_3)
  * Added patch from Stas Beckman for new DBI feature take_imp_data, needed
   for DBI::Pool
  * Fix to Statement.pm for old API call for numfields that caused
    warnings on 40numrows and akmisc tests
  * Fix to bind_ph to throw an error if trying to bind a non-numeric 
    value as numeric
  * Better fix for dealing with error condition in $sth->rows()
  * Fix to bind_param to throw error when trying to bind a non-numeric as
    numeric


2005-04-04 Patrick Galbraith <patg@mysql.com> (2.9015_2)
  * Merged all code changes from 2.900x tree from the last 9 
    months
    - unsafe bind type guessing patch from Dragonchild
    - Removed mysql.mtest
    - Fixed sth->rows to return my_ulongloong and also handle
      error from client API
    - Fix to make autocommit work was already part of this version
    - Auto-reconnect bug fixed in 2.9006 included 
  * Added simple test to 35limit test to check if using malicious code in
   LIMIT ?, ? placeholders works, which it doesn't.
  * Fix that sets mysql_server_prepare to 0 if SQL statement is 'SHOW ...'
    which is not supported by prepared statement API currently

2004-10-28 Rudolf Lippan <rlippan@remotelinux.com> (2.9015_1)
	* Merged Makefile.PL from 2.9005_3
	* Bumped version number to 2.9015 for release of Dev Branch. Which 
	  will become 2.9020 when tested and merged into HEAD.
	* fixed typo/compiler warning in bind_param_guessing 
	  '*testchar' should have been 'testchar'.

2004-10-20 Patrick Galbraith patg@mysql.com (Dev-2_9 - 2.9005)

  * merged changes from 2.9005_1
  * fix to blob in dbd_st_fetch (Alexey Stroganov ranger@mysql.com)
  In case of BLOB/TEXT fields we allocate only 8192 bytes in dbd_describe()
  for data. Here we know real size of field so we should increase buffer
  size and refetch column value

2004-07-25 Patrick Galbraith patg@mysql.com (2.9004)
  * Prepared statement support
* Use of mysql_stmt_* API (>= 4.1.3)
  * mysql_shutdown fix
* MySQL Embedded Server support (Alexey Stroganov)
  * Fixed link failure on MacOSX
  * Cleaned up tests
  * Fixed various compile warnings


2003-10-26  Rudy Lippan  <rlippan@remotelinux.com> (2.9003)
	* Applied patch from Aaron and Chuck that added basic testing of the 
	  table_info/column_info functions [Aaron Ross <aross@plusthree.com>]
	* Applied patch removing Jochen Wiedmann's contanct information and 
	  also removing the restriction on CD ROM distribution. 
	  [Jochen Wiedmen <joe@ispsoft.de>]
	* The check for the innodb table type was broken so the transaction
	  tests were skipped even though the database supported transactions.
	* :sql_types were not being inported in column info, so SQL_VARCAR was
	  thowing an error. Also, the :sql_types were not being pulled into 
	  DBD::mysq::db package
	* Patch for  dbdadmin.t so that it respects username and password
	  [Alexey Stroganov <ranger@mysql.com>]
	* Fix for memory leak in bind_param() introduced in 2.9002
	  (2.9002 changed bind_param so that changing the value of a scalar
	  after binding would not affect what was passed to execute eg: 
	     $sth->bind_param(1,$foo);
	     $foo = 'bar'
	     $sth->execute() -- $foo would contain 'bar')
	  [reported by <shildreth@emsphone.com>]
	* don't define dbd_discon_all so that mysql uses DBI's This fixes a 
	  bug whereby DBD::mysql was dropping perl's destruct level.
	* patch to myld so that it uses strict and fixes scoping problem 
	  with $contents [Jochen Wiedmann <joe@ispsoft.de>]
	* Modified Makefile.PL so that it gives a usage message
	  if any unknown options are passed in.
	* patch to INSTALL.pod on how to link DBD::mysql against 
	  a static libmysqlclient [Jochen Wiedmann <joe@ispsoft.de>]

2003-06-22  Rudy Lippan  <rlippan@remotelinux.com> (2.9002)
	* moved pod into mysql.pm from mysql.pod
	* Changed the default behaviour of mysql_found_rows, so now
	  'UPDATE table set field=?' will return the number of rows matched
	  and not the number of rows physically changed. You can get the old
	  behaviour back by adding "mysql_found_rows=0" to the dsn passed
	  to connect.
	* Updated type_info_all() to be more inline with 
	  what DBD::ODBC returns.
	* Added attribute 'mysql_auto_reconnect' that allows the auto reconnect
	  behaviour to be toggled. :
	  
	  ** NOTE** The behaviour of auto reconnect has changed.  If 
	  either the MOD_PERL or the GATEWAY_INTERFACE environment variable is
	  set, auto_reconnect will default to ON; otherwise auto_reconnect
	  will default to off.  Earlier versions of this driver would always
	  try to reconnect to the database on error; however, this is dangerous
	  because table locks could be lost without the application knowing.

	* Fixed a segfault with failed reconnects that were trapped in an
	  eval. The next tine DBD::mysql tried to reconnect, the process
	  would segfault.
	* Added statistics attribute, 'mysql_dbd_stats' which returns
	  a hash ref that contains 2 keys 'auto_reconnects_ok' and
	  'auto_reconnects_failed'.
	* Fixed bug where strings that were used in numeric
	  context were not getting quoted on execute(). Now all
	  parameters are bound as varchar by default.

	  **NOTE** this is a change in behaviour that MAY cause problems
	  with some SQL statements. If quoted integers, for example,  
	  cause any problems, use bind_param(<column_id>, undef, SQL_INTEGER)
	  to force a column to be bound as an integer.

	* Added get_info() method. See 'perldoc DBI' for more info
	* Added column_info(). See 'perldoc DBI' for more info [Tim Bunce]

2003-03-03  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (2.1026)

	* Fixed the handling of case insensitive file
	  names. Jan Dubois, <jand@ActiveState.com>
	* lib/Mysql.pm (listdbs): Added support for user
	  name and password.

2003-01-21  Jochen Wiedmann <joe@ispsoft.de> (2.1025)

        * lib/DBD/mysql.pm: added support for optional

	  insensitive file names and the like). Georg Rehfeld,
	  <georg.rehfeld@gmx.de>

	  (Workaround for a bug within Perl 5.00404)
	* tests/ak-dbd.t: Removed "local $sth->{PrintError} = 0"; yet
	  another workaround.

1998-07-28  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.21_00)

	  www.arcana.co.uk)
	* lib/DBD/mysql/Install.pm (Initialize): Added
	  $ENV{'MYSQL_HEADERDIR'} and $ENV{'MYSQL_LIBDIR'}.

	  some cases to prevent 5.005 warnings.
	* Added a section on multithrading to the manual.
	
1998-07-07  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.19_21)

	* nodbd/nodbd.pm.in (query): Fixed a missing "bless($sth, ...)".
	  My thanks to Ray Zimmermann <rz10@cornell.edu>. (Gives me
	  a familiar feeling to always meet the same people ... :-)

1998-07-06  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.19_20)

	* Makefile.lib (InitializeMsql): Added /usr to the search path
	  for mSQL headers and libraries.

	* dbd/dbdimp.c: Added $sth->{mysql_type} and
	  $sth->{msql_type}, which are in fact just what

	  returning portable SQL types.
	* MANIFEST: Removed nodbd/Makefile.PL.in.
	* Makefile.PL: Made test databases configurable.


1998-06-14  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.19_18)

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed typo in InitializeMsql (dbiDriver = mSQL1).
	* dbd/dbdimp.c: mysql_real_connect is now using a dbname
	  argument

	  NULL when password had zero length. (Erik Bertelsen,
	  erik@mediator.uni-c.dk)
	* dbd/dbdimp.c: One more time fixing reconnect problems with Mysql
	  and old client libraries (without mysql_real_connect it's just too

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed Bugs in _OdbcParse and version numbers.
	* dbd/dbimon.in: Fixed bugs in export mode (Nem W. Schlecht

	  and not 'undef'.
	* Requires DBI 0.93. (I assume it still works with 0.91, but
	  whoever reinstalls Msql-Mysql-modules can well reinstall
	  DBI.)
	* dbd/dbdimp.c: $sth->fetch* now inactivates the sth in case
	  of errors or no more data; this follows the specification of
	  the 'Active' attribute.
	* Added a missing DROP TABLE in ak-dbd.t.
	* Added ODBC style DSN's like DBI:mysql:database=test;host=localhost.

1998-01-20  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.19_02)

	* dbd/dbd.xs.in (quote): Fixed "int len" to "STRLEN len"; the
	  Irix compiler refuses to compile this. (A little bit picky,

	* Added "LISTINDEX" handling.
	* Makefile.lib: Now always linking against libgcc.a when using gcc
	  and compiling for MySQL.
	* tests/mysql.dbtest: Now using "IS NULL" in SQL queries instead

	* README: Added hint for not using msqlperl mailing lists
	  except for MsqlPerl and MysqlPerl related things.
	* Makefile.lib: Modified version number to contain underscores,

	* dbd/dbimon.in: Leaving pager mode worked unreliable; fixed.
	  Andreas Koenig <koenig@anna.mind.de>	
	* tests/akmisc.t, tests/mysql.t, tests/mysql2.t: Minor modifications
	  in the connect parameters for passing the test suite under
	  Windows/NT.

	  undef'd argument in connect method. (Chris Holt,
	  <xris@migraine.stanford.edu>)
	* nodbd/nodbd.xs.in: Fixed definition of 'HOST' attribute
	  in dbh's.
	* Makefile.lib (InitializeMsql): Fixed typo that made MSQL_HOME
	  useless. (Ray Zimmermann, <rz10@cornell.edu>)
	* Makefile.lib (InitializeMysql): Fixed typo "lib/mysqlclient.a"
	  to "lib/libmysqlclient.a". (Michael 'Monty' Widenius,
	  <monty@tcx.se>)

1997-12-31  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.1823)

	* Added support for mysql_use_result, requested by Jesse
	  Eversole <jee@marketdriven.com>.
	* nodbd/typemap: Replaced sv_isa with sv_derived_from so that
	  subclassing works, reported by Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>.
	
1997-12-11  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.1822)

	* dbd/myMsql.c: DSN's like DBI:mysql:test;hostname=$host;port=$port
	  haven't been working.
	* dbd/dbimon.in: POD modifications, suggested by Jesse N. Glick
	  <jglick@sig.bsh.com>

Sat Nov  1 17:04:27 1997  Jochen Wiedmann  <joe@ispsoft.de> (1.1820)

	* xtract: Added "#xtract <driver>" ... "#endxtract".

	* nodbd/statement.pm.in, nodbd/nodbd.pm.in, nodbd/pmsql.in:
	  Using "#xtract now".

	* Reorganized source tree (again).

	* t/ak-dbd.t, t/akmisc.t: Added tests for mysql's insertid
	  feature.

	* Merged source trees of Mysql and Msql.
	
	* lib/M(y)sql.pm: Added some words on createdb, dropdb and
	  shutdown to the man page. Missed by Ray Zimmermann

	* dbd/dbd.xs.in: Implemented $dbh->do as a direct XS call.

	* dbd/dbd.xs.in, nodbd/nodbd.xs.in: Suppressed some warnings

DBD::mysql for DBI - Written by Jochen Wiedmann <joe@ispsoft.de>

97.09.27 V1.1812
          Added t/50commit.t to test suite.
	  Included <embed.h> in myMsql.h for redefining my_setenv().
	  Made AutoCommit, Commit and Rollback DBI conformant.
	  Fixed reconnect problems with Mysql: mysql_port was 0 on some
	  systems.
	  Added support of mysql_real_connect to myMsql.c.
	  Fixed Msql::errno returning a char*.
	  Added lib/Bundle::Mysql.pm.
          Fixed 'use Mysql' to 'require Mysql' in t/mysql2.t.
	
97.09.12 V1.1810
	  Fixed bug in dbd_st_FETCH_internal: newRV_noinc was used for
	  the return value. This resulted in invalid cache values,
	  reported by Michael Bletzinger
	  <Michael.Bletzinger@ssa.crane.navy.mil>

97.09.12 V1.1809
	  Adapted changes from DBD-Oracle 0.46 to 0.47; in particular
	  the files Driver.xst and dbd_xsh.h from the DBI distribution
	  are used now. (LongReadLen, LongTruncOk, ... are still
	  meaningless, but they are not that important for m(y)sql:
	  The complete results are in RAM anyways ...)
          Fixed man page of DBD::M(y)SQL: "@names = $sth->{'NAME'}".
	  Added parameter completion for "set" command to dbimon.
	
97.09.08  V1.1808
	  Fixed bug in dbimon, a closing brace was missing causing a
	  syntax error.
	  Fixed problems in the Term::ReadLine::GNU support, reported
	  by Nem W. Schlecht (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu).
	  Modified dbimon for internally using the Data::ShowTable
	  module. My thanks to Tim Bunce for the hint.
	  Compatibility fixes for SunOS and Solaris, supplied by
	  Neil Bowers (neilb@cre.canon.co.uk).
	
97.09.03  V1.1806
          Fixed bug in Mysql.xs: $sth->numfields dumped core because no
	  check for a result was done.
	  Fixed bug in lib/Mysql/Statement.pm: Mysql::Statement.as_string
	  did not check for $sth->numfields != 0.
	  Added patch from Nem W. Schlecht (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu)
	  for Term::ReadLine::GNU support to pmysql and dbimon.
	
97.09.03  V1.1805
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: Executing a non-select statement
	  always returned -1 (unknown number of rows) although the
	  correct number was returned by $sth->rows().
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: strlen was executed on a NULL
	  value when mysql_fetch_rows returned a NULL field.
	  Added all _ListField attributes to statement handles.
	  Added support for "LISTFIELDS <table>" to $sth->execute.
	  Modified $sth->func("_ListSelectedFields") and
	  $dbh->func("<table>", "_ListFields") to use the new
	  possibilities; in fact these are only stubs now.
	  Added dbimon.
	  Added some internal attributes for dbimon to DBD::mysql:
	  format_default_size, format_max_size, format_type_name
	  and format_right_justification.
	
97.08.30  V1.1804
	  Added "fancy", "quote", "separator" and "escape" commands to
	  pm(y)sql.PL, patch supplied by Nem W Schlecht
	  (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu).
	  Modified pm(y)sql.PL and pmsql.PL so that it automatically
	  adapts pm(y)sql for use with Msql and Mysql, respectively.
	  Makefile.PL and M(y)sqlPerl/Makefile.PL now automatically
	  adapt lib/M(y)sql.pm, lib/M(y)sql/Statement.pm and
	  lib/DBD/mSQL.pm or lib/DBD/mysql.pm for use in Msql-modules
	  or Mysql-modules; just copy these files, rename them and
	  run "perl Makefile.PL".
	
97.08.29  V1.1803
	  Added mysql_errno()
	  Modified perl modules for use of $driver and isa($driver).
	  Modified Msql.xs and Mysql.xs for use of Package and
	  StPackage.
	  Modified test for fetch of non-result sth in akmisc.t: Msql
	  returns number of rows and not an sth.
	
97.08.27  Removed use of TEXT_TYPE from pmysql and Mysql/Statement.pm.

97.08.16  Modified mysql.xs, dbdimp.h and dbdimp.c for use in DBD::mSQL.
	  Now using Andreas König´s Makefile.PL from the DBD::mSQL
	  distribution.
	  Added check for disabled '-lgcc' on Linux; this leads to a
	  missing __moddi3 symbol in libmysqlclient.a, when running
	  mysql.so.

	  Added mysqlperl support.
	
97.08.02  Almost completely rewritten, with the exception of private
          functions like _ListTables.
          Implemented bind_param.
          Test suite rewritten for portability.
          Many sources moved from mysql.pm and mysql.xs to dbdimp.h;
          mysql.pm and mysql.xs are now close to Oracle.xs and Oracle.pm.

97.07.28  Added $dbh->quote method.
	  Modified internal use of "char* statement" to "SV* statement".
	  Modified use of mysql_query to mysql_real_query. (The above
	  three things should fix blob problems hopefully.)
	  Bumped revision number to 2.00 because of API changes:
	  The connect method works now as described in the DBI man
	  page, compatibility to DBD::msql seems deprecated.
	  Heavy internal modifications in order to use DBIS->get_fbav();
	  this gives compatibility to DBI 0.88.
	  Modified test suite to use Test::Harness.
	  Added blob tests.

	  The patch was done by gareth@netcom.co.uk & Monty

96.05.27  Changed Makefile.PL after suggestions from Raymond Wiker

96.04.25  Changed the README and fixed a typo in mysql.xs
	  Changed version to DBD-mysql-1.63.1 to have a reference to mSQL-0.63

96.11.03  Changed from DBD:mysql-0.60pl10 to DBD:mysql-1.0 by Michael Widenius


Original ChangeLog:

18/07/95:	Started. 

		Version 0.0.0 ( Totally pre-alpha! )

19/07/95:22:00	Code now basically seems to work. I've got connection to
		a database, and clean disconnection.

	 23:45	I'm now working on the statement cycle stuff, which I've
		mapped out. It's just a case of coding, which shouldn't
		take too long, hopefully.

		Posted notice of approaching doom to perldb-interest.

20/07/95:01:25	Fetching appears to work OK now. I need to read the API on
		msqlFieldSeek, since I can't work out why fetch is returning
		the same row over and over! 

21/07/95:09:22  Added a field into imp_sth (currow) which keeps track of the
                current row that's been fetched from the result struct. If I
                can fix the return codes coming from fetchrow, it'll work!

21/07/95:10:30  Pondered bind variables in cursors. Since there isn't a bind
                function in the API, I may have to frig the way that prepare/
                execute works, ie, move the call to msqlQuery *after* it's
                done some parsing for bind values......Hm.

21/07/95:10:35  Twiddled some bits in the fetchrow cycle. 

23/07/95:15:50  Fetch is fetching a row, but it's not returning it to the 
        	calling cycle, so I need to fart about with the sv stuff, which
		is not amusing me greatly!

26/07/95:23:42	Decided in agreement with Andreas that the first release is
		to be 0.61! 

27/07/95:14:14	Finally! It fucking works! After splendid quantities of
      		hacking around with the prepare/execute/fetchrow/finish cycle
		it's actually returning rows correctly!

		NOTE: The SV handling within dbd_describe is shot to buggery,
		      but I've kludged it in mSQL.xs::fetchrow to do a
		      sv_2mortal instead of a sv_mortalcopy.

27/07/95:14:22	Tidied up mSQL.xs::finish to do an msqlFreeResult. Annoyingly
		enough, there's no return code to msqlFR, so I can't test 
		whether or not it's worked! Bah!

27/07/95:15:15	Altered test to do several bits and bobs. I'm testing INSERT
		statements now. These only execute an msqlQuery, but the
		stuff needs to continue to pass through the execute and finish
		stages cleanly.......*sigh*

27/07/95:15:22	My dubious 'INSERT' check hack works, sort of. Pity it converts
		the entire statement to lower case.....! 

27/07/95:17:33	Twiddled some more stuff so it seems to do CREATE TABLE,
		INSERT statements too. Of course, there's no error checking
		yet, but it seems to be OK........Hm.

27/07/95:17:38	Mailed out a statement saying the 0.61 code would be up for
		grabs as of Monday 31st July! Still waiting on Alpha reports.

27/07/95:12:11	Fixed the lower-case all the INSERT/CREATE &c. statement bug.
		It now checks to see if you're in quotes.

28/07/95:xx:xx	Got a report back from Andreas to say  compilation barfs on
		his Indy. Fixed a load of do_error bugs in dbdimp.c. 

13/08/95:18:25  Finally got back to this after a rather long break. Fixed some
		Makefile.PL bugs that were kicking about. Finally fixed
		( or appeared to fix ) the strlen signedness bug in dbdimp.c
		that may halt compilation on the Indy. 

		Emailed Karsten the debug info to see what's causing problems
		on the NeXTStep platform.

14/08/95:13:48	Got email back from Andreas. signedness broke mSQL.xs as well!
		Fixed that and emailed him a quick patch.

14/08/95:14:45	Andreas now has a successful compile. The tests are crap, but
		appear to ( sort of ) work.

29/08/95:23:18	Converted driver across to new DBI format. It now appears
		to compile, install and run fairly reasonably. There are
		some serious messes that need cleared up in it, but it's
		fundamentally OK, I hope. Announced for pl0 testing.

04/09/95:15:04	Started back on getting the 0.60pl0 out. Tidied up the parsing
   		of statements for INSERT, CREATE &c statements. It just takes
		the first word of the statement now.

04/09/95:15:19	Looks OK. Tested against DBI 0.63 and looks reasonable.
		Announced release of 0.60pl1 and put up for ftp.

20/09/95:15:20	Patched a load of stuff including NULLs, and local device
		handling ( SV ). Released pl4, which was bogus. Released
		pl5 which should fix those issues.

20/09/95:22:17	Fixed overhang of old DBI bug with DBIc_ENDING remaining in
		DESTROY in mSQL.xs. Spotted by Marti Rijken and fixed.
		( Hopefully! )

18/10/95:15:13	Added in the missing API chunks for ListTables, ListDBs
		and ListFields.

		ListFields isnae working, but I'll fix that sometime soon....

05/11/95:11:32	Fixed $sth->readblob to return undef. Fixed Makefile.PL, 
		dbdimp.h, mSQL.h, dbdimp.c for release of 0.60pl7. Also tested
		'make test' which now works!

23/11/95:19:22	Fixed ListFields from the pointers given to me by Sven V.

24/11/95:03:13	Fixed error handling in all the func methods

24/11/95:13:01	Added 'NumRows' method to statement handles to return the
		number of rows returned ( or affected ) by a statement.o

30/12/95:18:10	Altered mSQL.pm to allow for hostname:port style connections
		to known remote port machines. Sets ENV var since the
		msqlConnect API call doesn't support port arguments.

30/12/95:18:15	Added 'length' key into the hash returned by ListFields, so
		we can get the scale of the field.

24/03/96:22:34	Fixed bugs and upgraded versioning for perl5.002 to work
		properly. Released as pl10

-> Lamentable lack of ChangeLog information here!

27/03/97: Tidied up things with regard to 0.61 release. 

28/03/97: Patched NULL as undef bug
